# Swerve Simulation: CTRE motor simulation


*This approach is for teams running Phoenix close-loops on the CTRE motor controllers (or other vendor-based hardware control loops on motor controllers). It uses data injection to pass simulation results to PhoenixLib simulation, which simulates the motor controller behavior, and use data injection to *
